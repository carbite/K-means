BEIJING - China ranked 34th among 193 countries around the world in terms of availability of online services in e-government development, according to a United Nations survey. 
The Party School of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs on Friday jointly issued the Chinese version of the United Nations E-Government Survey 2018 report. 
The survey tracks the progress of e-government development via the E-Government Development Index (EGDI), which assesses e-government development at the national level based on three dimensions -- telecommunication infrastructure, human resources to promote and use information and communication technologies, and online service availability. 
China ranked the 34th in the online service component and the 65th on the overall EGDI list. 
The theme for this year's survey is Gearing E-Government to Support Transformation towards Sustainable and Resilient Societies.
