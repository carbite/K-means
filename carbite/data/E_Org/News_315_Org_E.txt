BEIJING -- Premier Li Keqiang has called for efforts in strengthening the capacity in preventing and controlling forest fires and grassland fires during fire-prone seasons. 
In written instructions made public Friday, Li demanded progress in reforming the fire prevention and control mechanism for better coordination and asked authorities across the country to shoulder their responsibilities in fire prevention. 
Emergency response units at all levels should intensify the fire early warning and monitoring efforts and perform their duty in responding to fires, according to Li. 
Also on Friday, State Councilor Wang Yong attended a national teleconference on forest/grassland fire prevention and control. 
Wang, also head of the national headquarters of forest/grassland fire prevention and control, called for an immediate inspection of potential fire threats and deployment of the emergency rescue forces in high-risk areas in advance.
