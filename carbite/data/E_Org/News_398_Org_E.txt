Premier Li Keqiang called for strengthened cooperation in trade, investment, healthcare and education with Sierra Leone when he met with the African country's President Julius Maada Bio in Beijing on Sunday. 
Bio was to attend the 2018 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. 
The two countries have consistently offered help and support for each other, and forged a profound friendship when fighting against the Ebola epidemic, the premier said. 
As developing countries, China will provide enduring support to improve the economic and social development in Sierra Leone to achieve win-win cooperation, Li said and added he hopes the African country can provide more preferential policies and attract more Chinese investors. 
Bio extended his gratitude to China's sincere help during his country's difficult time, especially in the fight against Ebola. He said Sierra Leone is glad to learn from China's experiences in governance, and expand trade, investment and finance cooperation to further deepen bilateral relations.
