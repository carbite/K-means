New judicial guidelines proposed to safeguard core socialist values
          
          BEIJING -- China's Supreme People's Court (SPC) has released a 2018-2023 work plan to promote the full implementation of core socialist values in handling judicial interpretations.
Judicial interpretations are guidelines or instructions issued by the SPC on specific legal issues, which are binding on courts at all levels across China.
To meet the requirement of the values, the SPC will introduce a set of new guidelines to better protect the right of self-defense and interests of those who voluntarily acted against crimes, said an SPC statement Tuesday.
The work plan scheduled revisions on existing judicial interpretations to strengthen the protection of the reputation and honor of martyrs, and prevent school violence.
It also proposed revisions on judicial interpretations of handling intellectual property rights disputes and environmental cases.
Core socialist values comprise a set of moral principles: prosperity, democracy, civility, harmony, freedom, equality, justice, the rule of law, patriotism, dedication, integrity, and friendship.
