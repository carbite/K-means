BEIJING -- A senior Chinese official on Saturday called on staff at central and state organs to draw lessons from discipline violation cases and fight corruption. 
Ding Xuexiang, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, made the remarks at a meeting on anti-corruption education for those organs. 
Participants were briefed about typical violations made by leaders at central and state organs in recent years. 
"The anti-corruption situation in central and state organs remains tough and complicated, and requires strict party governance at all levels," said Ding, also secretary of the working committee for central and state organs. 
He called for strengthened supervision and tightened accountability for overseeing discipline compliance.
