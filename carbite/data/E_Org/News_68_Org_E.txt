China creates path of human rights protection suited to national conditions: White paper
          
          BEIJING -- Over the past four decades of reform and opening up, China has made significant progress in human rights, creating a new path of human rights protection based on China's history and national conditions, and the successful experiences of other countries, said a white paper released Wednesday by the State Council Information Office.
"This path is the result of the Chinese people's experimentation in practice and theoretical innovation led by the Communist Party of China, and embodies the essence of socialism with Chinese characteristics," said the document, titled "Progress in Human Rights over the 40 Years of Reform and Opening Up in China."
"Human rights protection centered on the people," said the white paper, noting that the people-centered development toward a better life was the original aspiration and remains the distinct goal of China's reform and opening up.
China has integrated the principle of universality of human rights with China's national conditions, it said.
China puts primary focus on the rights to subsistence and development and takes the coordinated progress in all human rights as a major principle for human rights protection, it stressed.
Also, China has provided institutional guarantee of human rights under the rule of law, the white paper said, adding that the country sees a community with a shared future for humanity as a way to improve global human rights governance.
