          The national crack down on organized crimes achieved positive results, according to the data of China's top procuratorate.
Chinese prosecutors detained 57,000 people suspected of involvement in organized crime, from January to September, according to Supreme People's Procuratorate.
In addition, 32,000 were prosecuted for organized crimes during the same period.
The prosecutors across the country also played the supervision role in cracking down on organized crimes, filing 510 cases and prosecuting more than 1,100 people.
In January, the nationwide drive was jointly launched by Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council, vowing to fight against the organized crime across the country and safeguard people's interest.
Supreme People's Procuratorate also cooperated with the Ministry of Public Security to supervise and handle 24 important gang-related cases in several provinces, including Hebei, Henan and Yunnan.
