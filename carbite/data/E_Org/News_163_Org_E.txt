China is willing to work with international organizations, including six key ones, such as the World Bank and the IMF, to cope with risks arising from challenges against economic globalization and financial turbulence, Premier Li Keqiang said on Tuesday. Li made the statement in a roundtable dialogue in which he hosted discussions with World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde, World Trade Organization Director-General Roberto Azevedo, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Secretary-General Angel Gurria, Financial Stability Board Chairman Mark Carney, and International Labor Organization Deputy Director-General Deborah Greenfield.The premier said recovery of the world economy is continuing but with disturbing risks and challenges. Economic globalization is facing unprecedented challenges from rising unilateralism, protectionism and nationalism. Trade frictions are on a rise under a changed setting for international economic cooperation, which affected the confidence in multilateral trading system and globalization, he said. Some international organizations have reduced the global economic growth rates for this year and next year. On the other hand, the global financial market is in turbulence. Developed countries are conducting tightening monetary policies, leading to greater risk of global liquidity and impact on currencies of emerging economies, Li said. China is willing to work with international organizations to tackle these risks, he added.
