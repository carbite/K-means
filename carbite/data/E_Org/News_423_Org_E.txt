Six draft sections on specific areas of civil law were submitted to China's top legislature on Monday, beginning the second phase of formulating the country's long-awaited civil code. 
The draft on inheritance includes printed and video wills to adapt to the development of science and technology, said Yang Minglun, an official with the Legislative Affairs Commission under the National People's Congress Standing Committee. 
The draft amended the regulation on will validity by deleting the priority of notarial wills in inheritance law to respect the true will of the testator, Yang said. 
The draft stipulates ways to select a heritage manager, and the manager's responsibilities and rights to make sure the estate is properly managed and divided, safeguard the interests of inheritors and creditors and reduce disputes, said Shen Chunyao, head of the Legislative Affairs Commission under the NPC Standing Committee. 
In order to protect creditor interests and make sure related taxes are paid, the draft stipulates the heritage can be divided after the deceased's debts are paid off and related taxes are paid.
