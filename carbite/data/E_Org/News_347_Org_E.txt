China to keep infrastructure investment stable, Premier says
          
          As a developing country, China still has shortcomings in infrastructure construction, and the Chinese government will increase supplies of public products and promote reasonable and effective investment in this area, Premier Li Keqiang&nbsp;said on Wednesday.
Li made the remark at the opening ceremony of the Annual Meeting of New Champions in Tianjin, also known as Summer Davos.
It is not a new round of massive economic stimulus but an effort to hedge downward pressure of investment growth, so as to keep infrastructure investment stable, Li said. China will not take the old path of heavy reliance on investment, he said.
