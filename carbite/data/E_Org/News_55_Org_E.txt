A Chinese fugitive accused of corruption returned to China on Friday to turn himself in after spending 11 years on the run in New Zealand. 
Jiang Lei, 62, former executive vice-chairman of China Association of Automobile Manufactures, fled to New Zealand on April 11, 2007, according to the Communist Party of China Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. 
The people's procuratorate of Beijing's Xicheng district approved the arrest for Jiang on June 18 of 2007, and the Interpol issued a red notice on him on July 27 the same year. 
A CCDI statement released on Friday said Jiang's return once again shows China's resolute determination to "hunt down the fugitives and confiscate their illicit assets no matter where they escape". 
In August, Chinese authorities released a notice to encourage overseas fugitives to return and confess their crimes by the end of this year to seek for a lenient punishment.
