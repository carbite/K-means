          BEIJING - Wang Sanyun, former vice chairman of the Education, Science, Culture and Public Health Committee of the 12th National People's Congress, was charged with taking bribes, the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP) announced Wednesday.
The Municipal People's Procuratorate of the city of Zhengzhou in central China's Henan Province has recently filed Wang's case to Zhengzhou Intermediate People's Court, the SPP said.
Wang, who also served as deputy secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) provincial committee of southwest China's Guizhou Province, governor of east China's Anhui Province, and secretary of the CPC provincial committee of northwest China's Gansu Province, was charged with taking advantages of his positions to benefit others and accepting a huge amount of money and property.
The SPP also announced that prosecutors had indicted two other former officials, Zhou Chunyu, former vice governor of Anhui Province, and Cai Xiyou, former general manager of state-owned chemical firm Sinochem Group.
Zhou will stand trial for taking bribes, concealing offshore deposits, abuse of power, and insider trading, based on investigations by the Provincial People's Procuratorate of east China's Shandong Province and public security bureau of the eastern city of Qingdao.
The Municipal People's Procuratorate of Jinan City in Shandong has filed Zhou's case with the Jinan Intermediate People's Court.
Cai will stand trial at Tai'an Intermediate People's Court in Shandong on charges of bribery by the Municipal People's Procuratorate of Tai'an City, following a completed investigation by Shandong Provincial People's Procuratorate.
He was charged with using his posts, including senior vice president of Chinese oil giant Sinopec Corp., to seek profits for others as well as illegally asking for and accepting a huge amount in bribes.
Prosecutors have informed the defendants of their rights, interviewed them, and listened to their lawyers' remarks, the SPP said.
