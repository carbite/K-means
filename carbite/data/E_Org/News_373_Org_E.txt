Former Party member pleads guilty to bribery
          
          Mo Jiancheng, a former member of the Communist Party of China (CPC) committee of the Ministry of Finance, pleaded guilty to taking bribes of 42.59 million yuan ($6.2 million) on Wednesday, Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court announced on Wednesday.
Mo, 62, was formerly a leader of the disciplinary inspection team sent by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) to the Finance Ministry.
Mo is accused of taking advantage of his posts to seek profit for certain businesses and individuals. He helped company operations, loan applications, project approvals and promotions of personnel while serving in a number of leadership positions.
Mo accepted large amounts of money and property directly or through his son, reaching a total of 42.59 million yuan.
Mo responded to evidence presented by prosecutors, and both he and his attorney were cross-examined and were able to fully express their opinions, according to the court.
After a final statement was delivered, he admitted guilt and expressed remorse.
The court said more than 70 people attend the trial, including Mo's relatives, members of the National People's Congress, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the media and the public.
Mo's sentence will be announced at a later date, the court said.
Mo was expelled from the Party and dismissed from public office for corruption and violating the Party's code of conduct in September 2017, according to China's anti-corruption watchdog, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.
