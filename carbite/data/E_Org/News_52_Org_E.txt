BEIJING -- Chinese authorities, including the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, have launched a nationwide campaign to crack down on substandard and counterfeit food products in rural areas. 
The operation aims to effectively address six types of major crime before the Chinese Lunar New Year, which falls on Feb 5, 2019. 
Law enforcement agencies will target instant food, snacks, alcohol, condiments as well as dairy and meat products, consumption of which is large in rural areas, while fake label information, knock-offs and substandard products are high on the campaign agenda. 
"We will leave no stones unturned in tracking useful tips to bust as many illegal factories and workshops as possible," said Han Changfu, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. "Those found responsible of related crimes will receive industry access bans and be transferred to the police if needed."
