BEIJING -- China's top political advisor Wang Yang Friday met with a delegation from ethnic minority groups in Beijing, urging them to contribute to boosting ethnic unity and prosperity. 
Wang, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), applauded the tradition of ethnic minority delegations visiting some areas of the motherland. 
The visits allow people from ethnic minority groups to better understand the development and reform of the country, said Wang, adding that the visits also help enhance their connection with the country, the Chinese nation, Chinese culture, the Communist Party of China (CPC) and socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
Wang called on members of the delegation to continue supporting the CPC, safeguarding ethnic unity and prosperity, promoting poverty reduction and development of ethnic regions and contributing to reform and opening up. 
The delegation was made up of 214 outstanding members of ethnic minority groups from across the country who have been recognized for their contributions to national solidarity. They visited Sichuan, Shaanxi and Hebei before arriving in Beijing.
