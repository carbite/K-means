The Annual General Meeting of the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development provides a positive platform for countries to share experiences and practices in protecting ecosystems and promoting low carbon and green development, participants said on Saturday. 
"It serves as a communicative platform for China and the world in the area of environmental development, a coordinated platform for building up ecological civilization, and an innovative platform for improving a global environmental governance system," Li Ganjie, China's ecology and environment minister, said at the meeting's closing ceremony. 
The policies recommended at the meeting are valuable to global sustainable development and applicable for the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, he added.
