The Supreme People's Court is coordinating with related departments, trying to set up an intellectual property court by the end of this year, Economic Daily reported. 
The Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress on Friday adopted a resolution during its bimonthly session to mandate the Supreme People's Court to handle cases related to intellectual property rights, which require more expertise. 
The move is to provide judicial service and guarantee to build the country into a world power in IP, science and technology, according to the resolution. 
The resolution stipulates that parties that do not agree to the first civil or administrative rulings of IP cases can appeal to the Supreme People's Court. 
The resolution comes into effect on Jan 1, 2019. The Supreme People's Court will report the implementation result to the NPC Standing Committee three years later.
