Kevin Collins, managing director of Accenture: 
From the letter it is clear the entire country is behind this push for internet development, and it is very nice to see one official after another get up and say effectively the same thing that brings everyone together, that puts together a construct across the world that works for the benefit of all. It is really amazing to see the similarity of the message across everyone that we saw today. It is amazing for me to be able to come here and see all whatâ€™s going on, especially considering how fast and how dynamically China is changing.
