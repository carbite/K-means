Six draft sections on specific areas of civil law were submitted to China's top legislature on Monday, beginning the second phase of formulating the country's long-expected civil code. 
The draft on contract makes rules on the conclusion and execution of e-contracts to adapt to the fast growing e-commerce and digital economy and regulate electronic transactions. 
The draft stipulates that an e-contract is formed after a buyer submits an order, unless the parties have agreed otherwise. 
If a buyer purchases a commodity and it is delivered by express delivery, the delivery time is when the buyer signs to receive the delivery. 
If a buyer purchases a service, the delivery time is when an e-receipt or receipt is produced. If there is no time on the e-receipt or receipt or the time is different from the time of service, the delivery time is when the actual service is rendered.
