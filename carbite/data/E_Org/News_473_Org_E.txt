The Communist Party of China (CPC) has initiated a campaign to promote a "patriotic striving spirit" among the country's intellectuals. 
The campaign aims to rally outstanding intellectuals for "the pursuing of the great endeavor of the Party and the people," and build a talent pool consisting of bright people with a spirit of patriotism, devotion and innovation, according to a circular jointly issued by the CPC organization and publicity departments earlier this week. 
The campaign will focus on young and middle-aged intellectuals, with activities such as media promotion, study and discussion sessions, special training and promotion of exemplary models, according to a statement from both departments. 
It will also encourage intellectuals to maintain a patriotic spirit in their practical work. 
Special characteristics and the diversity of the intelligentsia must be given full respect, the statement said.
