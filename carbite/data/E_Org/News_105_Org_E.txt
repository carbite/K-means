After six years of planning, design and construction, parts of the Beijing municipal government have moved from the capital's downtown center to Tongzhou district, and other departments will gradually start moving as well. 
According to Capitalnews, a Wechat account owned by Beijing Daily, early Friday morning multiple governmental departments including the Beijing poverty relief office and the Beijing Youth League committee, have started working in new office buildings in Tongzhou, marking the moment these new municipal government buildings have officially come into use. 
According to the plan, all departments of Beijing government will move to Tongzhou, an attempt to ease traffic and population density in the capital's central area.
