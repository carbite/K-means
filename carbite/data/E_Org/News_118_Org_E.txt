China will promote peace talks between Palestine and Israel, and will continue to play an active role in the comprehensive and fair settlement of the Palestinian issue at an early date, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday. 
Xi made the remark as he exchanged congratulatory messages with his Palestinian counterpart Mahmoud Abbas on the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties. 
Highlighting the long-standing friendship between China and Palestine, Xi said that since the two nations established ties three decades ago, they have developed ties and cooperation in various fields, and made fruitful achievements. 
Xi said he values the development of the bilateral ties and that he is ready to work with Abbas to further advance cooperation between the two countries so as to deliver more benefits to both peoples. 
China has been supporting the Palestinian people's just cause to restore their legitimate national rights, and firmly supports the establishment of an independent state of Palestine that enjoys full sovereignty, with East Jerusalem as its capital, and based on the 1967 borders, through Palestinian-Israeli talks, Xi said. 
Abbas said in the congratulatory message to Xi that he takes pride in the traditional friendship between the two countries and the two peoples. 
He highly appreciates China's significant role in supporting the Palestinian people and their undertakings, and he will continue to promote the sound development of the countries' relationship to benefit the two peoples and realize their shared visions, Abbas said. 
On the same day, Premier Li Keqiang and Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah also exchanged congratulatory messages.
