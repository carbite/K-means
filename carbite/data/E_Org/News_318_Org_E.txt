SHIJIAZHUANG -- China's top legislator Li Zhanshu has stressed the need to take Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the guide in improving and developing the system of people's congresses and the legislatures' work. 
Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, made the remarks at a symposium on the study and implementation of the important thoughts of Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, on upholding and improving the system of people's congresses. 
Such work should also be conducted under the centralized, unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi at the core, Li said at the event, which was held Wednesday and Thursday in Shijiazhuang, capital of north China's Hebei Province. 
Xi's discourses on upholding and improving the system of people's congresses and developing socialist democracy are important components of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, Li said. 
The key to upholding and improving the system of people's congresses in the new era is to uphold Party leadership, especially the centralized, unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee, and to fully implement the Party's theories, lines, principles, policies, decisions and plans through the system of people's congresses, Li said. 
The legislatures' work should be carried out with more efforts focused on implementing major decisions and plans of the CPC Central Committee, responding to the public's major concerns, and advancing law-based governance in all fields, Li said. 
Attendees stressed the importance to uphold and improve the system of people's congresses in the new era, expressing their commitment to the decisions of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi at the core.
