China issues guidelines to categorize general aviation operations
          
          BEIJING -- China will categorize general aviation flights, aiming to facilitate the development of the industry, according to the civil aviation authorities.
The guidelines will be implemented based on the public benefit and operation risks control, said the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC).
The new categories for China's general aviation will introduce a new management system that will classify each flight into a specific categorized sector, according to the CAAC.
The focus of the new management model will be on flights with passengers using general aviation aircraft. The current model commonly requires a pre-flight application before takeoff. The new model aims to streamline the application process, gradually transitioning to using an after-flight report, said the guidelines.
For non-passenger general aviation flights, the civil aviation authorities will simplify and relax the market access conditions.
The new guidelines aim to boost the popularity and operation of the country's general aviation industry, which is a driving force of the economy and people's welfare. In addition, the guidelines were issued to ease the current strict regulations, allowing aviation authorities to focus more on safety management and services.
Civil aviation authorities will be responsible for the assessment of related enterprises in the general aviation industry, inviting third-party institutions for assessment.
Enterprises who violate regulations will receive increased punishment.
