Setting up the first experimental zone for international agricultural cooperation in China demonstrates the country's determination to intensify opening-up in agriculture, an official with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said on Tuesday. 
"We should put more emphasis on innovation and quality in international agricultural cooperation in the new era," Sui Pengfei, head of international cooperation at the ministry, told a news conference. "This is just a new start, and more similar experimental zones will be built." 
The State Council, China's Cabinet, approved the establishment of Weifang National Pilot Zone for Agricultural Opening-up and Development, in Weifang, Shandong province, at the end of August, to promote international agricultural cooperation. 
The zone will become a high-end platform for research and development of agricultural sciences and technologies, innovation and the industrial application of technological achievements, Tian Qingying, mayor of Weifang, said. 
Various industries, including modern agriculture and food, international trade and cross-border e-commerce, will be encouraged to develop in the zone, he said. 
The zone will conduct intensive international cooperation in areas including trade of agricultural products and technological innovation, and build itself into a platform for agricultural investment and cooperation with key countries, Tian said.
