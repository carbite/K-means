Premier Li calls to spur social creativity through entrepreneurship and startups
          
          Premier Li Keqiang on Wednesday called for stimulating market vitality and social creativity to achieve inclusive development and boost new drivers by spurring the enthusiasm and creativity of Chinaâ€™s large labor force.
He made the statement in a keynote speech at the opening ceremony of the annual meeting of New Champions in Tianjin, known as Summer Davos. China has a labor force of nearly 900 million people, including more than 170 million who received higher education or have special skills, Li said.
Entrepreneurship and business startups should be promoted to endow college graduates, overseas returnees, and migrant workers who returned to their hometowns, with opportunities to join innovation-driven development, which can increase jobs, create wealth and achieve their pursuit of values, Li added.
