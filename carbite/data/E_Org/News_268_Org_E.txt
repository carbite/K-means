Wang Qishan: China will deepen reform and further open up economy
          
          Vice-President Wang Qishan said on Friday that China will steadfastly deepen reform and further open up as all countries in the world are closely connected.
Wang made the remark when meeting with overseas members and members from Chinese enterprises of the advisory board of the School of Economics and Management at Tsinghua University.
China has entered a new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, he said, and China will continue to enhance the mutual understanding of history and realities between China and other nations during the exchanges and cooperation among people.
Wang said Chinese economy has turned from high-speed development to realizing high-quality progress, and he hoped the members can continue to actively participate in and witness China's economic construction, and contribute to China's communication and cooperation with other countries in various areas.
