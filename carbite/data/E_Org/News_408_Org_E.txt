China's Ministry of National Defense Thursday announced military exchange and cooperation plans with multiple countries and organizations. 
China will hold maritime military exercises with ASEAN countries in October in the waters off the city of Zhanjiang, south China's Guangdong Province, said spokesperson Wu Qian, adding that China and the 10 ASEAN countries will all participate in the exercises. 
Wu noted that the exercises mainly include the application of the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea and maritime search and rescue operations. 
China will also strengthen military cooperation with Africa in terms of personnel training, equipment, peacekeeping, health needs and other areas, Wu said. 
Wu added that China will help strengthen the self-development of Africa's security capacities and strive for a new era of China-Africa military ties. 
The Chinese military will take part in the Vostok-2018 (or East-2018) strategic drills in Russia, Wu said, noting that the deployment of personnel and equipment for the drills is in progress. 
Wu also said the eighth Xiangshan Forum will be held in Beijing from Oct. 24 to 26.
