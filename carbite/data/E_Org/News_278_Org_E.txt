CPPCC vice-chairman calls for better quality proposals
          
          The quality of proposals from China's top political advisory body should be further improved and those proposals should be better handled, said Zhang Qingli, vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
He called for the country's political advisors and the departments handling proposals to strive together to promote a high-quality proposal process in the new era during a three-day symposium that began Wednesday in Beijing.
&quot;We will strengthen the coordination among different departments, give play to the role of good experience, and steadily improve the quality and effectiveness of our proposals,&quot; he said.
