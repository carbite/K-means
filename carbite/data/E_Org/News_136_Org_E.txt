Judicial administrations and bar associations across China will set up legal teams to provide free services to private enterprises this year, the Ministry of Justice said on Wednesday. 
"The national activity is aimed at meeting the needs of companies, safeguarding their rights and interests and helping them improve their governance structures," said Zhou Yuansheng, a senior ministry official. 
The move will also help prevent legal risks, resolve disputes and improve operations, management and decision-making based on rule of law, as well as provide solid legal protection for the development of the private economy, he said. 
Zhou said local judicial organs and bar associations will formulate plans and set up teams of lawyers to provide companies with one-on-one services. 
Lawyers will need to understand a company's legal governance before analyzing its needs, risks and weaknesses, and for issues that can be solved immediately lawyers will offer counseling and advice, according to the ministry. 
For more complex problems, the teams will make suggestions based on a professional perspective to help companies perfect their governance structures and strengthen their risk prevention capabilities. 
After completing the services, lawyers will provide feedback to companies and their associations. Local judicial organs and associations will analyze the feedback and draft a comprehensive report including opinions and suggestions, which will serve as a reference for policymakers. 
Zhou said the lawyers can do their jobs through various methods, including field visits and discussions, or conduct remote and online consultations to increase efficiency. 
Judicial organs and bar associations at all levels should work closely and proactively with industrial and commercial organizations to carry out special services if needed, he said. 
He said all participating parties should learn from experience and strive to establish a long-term system so that lawyers can contribute more to deepening China's rule of law and help promote development of the private economy. 
"The ministry will pay close attention to the implementation to effectively improve the execution of work," Zhou said.
