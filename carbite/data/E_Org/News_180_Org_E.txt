          Feng Lizhi, former deputy head of the China Welfare Lottery Distribution and Management Center at the Ministry of Civil Affairs, has been placed under investigation for alleged graft in lottery management, the Communist Party of China's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said on Wednesday.
Feng, 59, was serving as deputy head of the China Center for Children's Welfare and Adoption when he was detained for investigation in October.
He is being investigated by the CCDI and National Supervisory Commission for violating Party disciplines and the law.
In September, Wang Suying, former head of the China Welfare Lottery Distribution and Management Center, was placed under investigation by the CCDI and National Supervisory Commission for multiple offenses, including bribery.
