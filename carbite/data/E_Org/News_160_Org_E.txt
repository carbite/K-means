Reform, opening-up driving force for cross-Straits relations: senior official
          
          BEIJING - China's top political advisor Wang Yang on Tuesday noted that China's reform and opening-up is a significant driving force for the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations.
Wang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, made the remarks while meeting a business delegation from Taiwan's Federation of Industries.
As this year marks the 40th anniversary of opening-up, the Chinese mainland has put forward a series of new measures under the reform policy, he said, believing that the measures will further improve development conditions and sense of fulfillment of different market entities including Taiwanese enterprises. He added that Taiwan compatriots will also enjoy better development prospects on the mainland.
Speaking highly of the federation's contributions to cross-Straits economic cooperation and the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations, Wang noted that national reunification and rejuvenation is the common expectation of all people of the Chinese nation.
"Compatriots across the strait should be in line with the historical trend, shoulder the causes of the nation together, resolutely oppose and deter any plot or act of 'Taiwan independence', and push forward the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations and the process toward the peaceful reunification of China with action," Wang said.
