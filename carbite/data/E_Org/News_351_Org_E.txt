          China will further open its door wider and deepen reforms, lower the threshold of market access, improve policy transparency and conduct equitable supervision, Premier Li Keqiang said at the opening ceremony of the annual meeting of New Champions in Tianjin, also known as Summer Davos, on Wednesday.
