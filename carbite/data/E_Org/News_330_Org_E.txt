China expressed strong dissatisfaction on Tuesday over "irresponsible comments" some countries and organizations made about the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government's ban of a separatist organization, and urged them to stop interfering in China's internal affairs. 
The Hong Kong SAR government issued the order in its gazette on Monday to ban operation of the "Hong Kong National Party", an organization advocating "Hong Kong independence". 
The ban drew critical comments from the UK and the European Union. A US consulate spokesman also criticized the decision, according to the South China Morning Post. 
China is "strongly dissatisfied over, and resolutely opposed to irresponsible comments individual countries and institutions made" over the ban, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang responded on Tuesday. 
"Any organization and behavior advocating 'Hong Kong independence' and engaged in activities to separate the country should never be tolerated," Geng said, adding that the Hong Kong SAR government made the decision according to relevant laws and legal procedure. 
The decision is a move necessary to protect national security and Hong Kong's rule of law, Geng said, adding that the ban belongs to the special administrative region's affairs, as well as China's internal affairs, which no other country is allowed to meddle in. 
"We request those countries and institutions to respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and stop interfering in Hong Kong's affairs and China's internal affairs under the guise of 'freedom of expression and association'," Geng said.
