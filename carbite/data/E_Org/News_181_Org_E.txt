China, the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide, has cut its carbon intensity by 46 percent over the 2005 level, said Li Gao, director of climate change of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, on Wednesday. 
China made a promise at the 2009 Copenhagen climate change summit to cut the intensity of carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 40 to 45 percent by 2020 from the 2005 base level, said Li. In 2017, the country's carbon intensity dropped by 46 percent from the 2005 level, which means it fulfilled the promise three years ahead of schedule.&nbsp; 
China also pledged at the 2015 Paris Climate Conference to reach the peak of carbon emissions at around 2030, and raise the percentage of non-fossil fuel power consumption to 20 percent by then. In 2017, the share stood at 13.9 percent. 
Li said after years of forestation efforts, the country has a forest stock volume of 15.1 billion cubic meters, an increase of 1.4 billion cubic meters from 2005, which creates a solid foundation for the nation to reach its emission reduction target.
