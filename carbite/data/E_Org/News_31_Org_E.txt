Draft revision of law regarding judges submitted for second review
          
          Judges will be given more respect and protection, according to a draft revision to China's judicial law.
The draft highlights the dignity and protections for judges, clarifying that revenge on judges and their family members is banned by any individual or department.
Those who harm, insult, disturb or threaten judges and their family members will be strictly punished, the draft said.
The draft was submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the country's top legislature, for the second review on Sunday.
It also stipulates that judges are not allowed to teach or engage in research at universities or academic institutes.
In December last year, the draft revision to the law was submitted to the legislature for the first reading. Generally a draft is passed and becomes a law after three reviews.
