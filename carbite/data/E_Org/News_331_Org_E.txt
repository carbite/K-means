Tourist payments, education in focus
          
          A number of ministries, including the National Development and Reform Commission, the State Administration of Press and Publication, and the Ministry of Public Security, have responded to issues of public concern. 
Oversight strengthened for scenic area payments  
The central government will step up oversight over payment methods at scenic spots nationwide to punish the refusal to accept cash during transactions. 
 
  
 
A notice jointly released on Wednesday by three departments, including the National Development and Reform Commission, said that more efforts should be made to ensure adequate cash supply at key tourists cities and scenic spots nationwide. 
Financial institutions and non-banking payment organs are banned from promoting the use of non-cash payment methods through false advertising and large subsidies. 
The notice also urged more to be done to accelerate the development of currency exchange services in key scenic spots, airports, hotels, major shopping malls and key tourists routes so that currency exchange demand from overseas tourists can be better met. 
The number of ATMs should also be increased, and more will be done to ensure a smooth cash supply through such machines. 
The quality of services for tourists should also be improved so that the payment demands for different types of tourists can be met. Scenic spots are also required to provide more secure and diversified payments methods, according to the notice.
