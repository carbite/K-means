The 17th National Congress of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions opened at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Monday. More than 2,000 delegates from around the country attended the opening sessions. 
Founded on May 1, 1925, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions is now the world's largest labor union. According to Wang Dongming, president of the federation, the trade union now has more than 300 million members, 140 million of whom are migrant workers from rural areas seeking jobs in cities. 
"More than 60 percent of delegates are front-line workers, compared with 47.9 percent in 2013 when the 16th National Congress was held," said federation spokesman Wang Xiaofeng. 
In the next few days, delegates from around the country will discuss major labor topics and put forward various recommendations during the five-day congress. They also will elect a new group of federation leaders.
