BEIJING - China unveiled a plan on Wednesday to promote the construction of the Huaihe River green economic belt in a bid to foster regional economic and ecological development. 
The plan, issued by the National Development and Reform Commission, maps out the strategic positions and targets of the economic belt. 
It will be developed as a demonstration area for ecological civilization, distinctive industries, a new type of urbanization, and central and eastern regional cooperation, said the plan. 
By 2035, the plan aims to build the economic belt into a beautiful and dynamic area with an improved ecological environment, boosting the local economy and narrowing the gap between urban and rural areas. 
Covering 243,000 square km, the Huaihe River green economic belt refers to surrounding areas along the Huaihe River in central and eastern China. 
By the end of 2017, the gross domestic product of the area had reached 6.75 trillion yuan (about 976 billion US dollars), with 146 million permanent residents.
