In first visit by a Chinese head of state, Xi provides momentum for a stronger relationship 
Facts have proved, and will continue to prove, that it was absolutely right for China and Panama to establish diplomatic ties, as they have brought real benefits to the people of both sides, President Xi Jinping said on Monday. 
Xi made the remark during talks with his Panamanian counterpart, Juan Carlos Varela, in Panama City. Xi's state visit to the Central American country is the first by a Chinese head of state. The two countries established diplomatic relations in June 2017. 
Witnessed by the two presidents, China and Panama signed a series of cooperation documents. The two leaders spoke highly of the cooperation outcomes achieved since the establishment of diplomatic relations, and they found many points of consensus on promoting bilateral relations. 
Over the past 18 months, the two presidents have paid visits to each other, and the two sides have deepened mutual political trust, Xi said.
