          BEIJING -- The Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee has decided to posthumously bestow the title of "national outstanding CPC member" upon four late members.
The decision has been made aiming to honor role models who are "firm in belief, loyal to the Party, and bold in taking on responsibilities and actions in the new era," and to encourage other members to perform their duties and and attain outstanding achievements, according to a statement of the CPC Central Committee.
Three of the honored CPC members worked for the 760 Research Institute of the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, and the other was a militia member who spent 32 years guarding an island post.
Huang Qun, born in May 1967, Sun Yuecai, born in January 1957, and Jiang Kaibin, born in December 1956, gave up their lives to protect a national experimental platform against a typhoon on Aug 20.
Wang Jicai, who used to be head of the militia post on Kaishan Island in East China's Jiangsu Province and secretary of the Party branch of Kaishan Island village, started working on the island in the Yellow Sea with his wife in 1986. He died of sudden illness while on duty in July at the age of 58.
