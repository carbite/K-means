Ministry appoints police conduct supervisors from public
          
          BEIJING &nbsp;-- The Ministry of Public Security has appointed 110 representatives from all walks of life as supervisors to oversee police conduct.
These supervisors include national legislators and political advisors as well as representatives of grassroots workers and farmers, according to a statement issued by the ministry earlier this week.
In addition to police conduct, the supervisors are also entitled to check the conduct of Communist Party of China (CPC) members and the work of officials within the public security system.
Noting the irreplaceable role of these supervisors, Deng Weiping, chief inspector of the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission at the ministry, called on them to pass on the voices from to public to related authorities in a timely manner.
They are also encouraged to get a better knowledge of grassroots police work, give suggestions in this regard and help rally support from the public to create a better environment for police work.
