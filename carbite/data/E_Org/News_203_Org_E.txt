NANJING - A new batch of historical materials, which present new evidence of the Imperial Japanese Army's war crimes during the 1937 Nanjing Massacre and enslavement of "comfort women", were donated to the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall on Saturday. 
A total of 41 items of historical documents and objects were donated by collectors in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Kunming, Nanjing, and Japan. 
The donations include bullets that Japanese troops used on the battlefields in Nanjing, a war history book from Japan, some pastry moulds used by Japanese soldiers to mark the occupation of Nanjing, souvenir medals, as well as old photos taken and postcards issued when Japanese troops invaded Nanjing. The donated items about "comfort women" include a mirror and a copper pot. 
Ling Xi, deputy curator of the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall, said the hall's museum has received a total of 1,593 new items this year, most of which serve as vital evidence of Japan's invasion of China. 
These historical documents will be digitalized at the memorial hall's digital center, which will open to researchers from across the world in the future, Ling said.
