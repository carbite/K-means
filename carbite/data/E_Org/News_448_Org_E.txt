          BEIJING - China's Ministry of Civil Affairs on Wednesday unveiled new measures to support the fight against poverty.
These include strengthening social welfare support, mobilizing non-governmental organizations, volunteers, philanthropists to join the anti-poverty campaign, improving subsidies for people with disabilities, providing better care for the elderly and left-behind children in rural areas, and improving community-level governance and its oversight.
The measures were announced by Civil Affairs Minister Huang Shuxian at a national teleconference, who called on civil affairs officials at all levels to further cut red tape and prevent corruption while increasing efficiency and transparency at work.
The Chinese leadership has pledged to win the battle against poverty in less than three years. According to the plan, by the year 2020, all rural residents will have been lifted out of poverty.
