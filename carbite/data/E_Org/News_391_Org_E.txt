Military issues document on strengthening Party building
          
          BEIJING -- The Central Military Commission (CMC) has issued a document on the decision to strengthen Party building in the armed forces in the new era.
The document noted that the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Party building are crucial to the building and development of the military, saying that work in these regards must be comprehensively intensified.
The decision stressed that the absolute Party leadership over the armed forces must be reinforced and the system of the chairman of the CMC assuming full responsibility for military affairs should be fully enforced.
The document called for efforts to eliminate the pernicious influence of former CMC vice chairmen Guo Boxiong and Xu Caihou.
It said that the military should focus on its war preparedness and combat capability as its principal work. It also called for resolute efforts to win the battle against corruption in the military.
Noting that strengthening CPC leadership and Party building in the military in the new era is a major political responsibility, the document underlined relevant duties for Party committees, disciplinary authorities and leading officials at all levels.
