China's top court has said it is working on a judicial interpretation to clarify when self-defense should be considered excessive and what penalties offenders should face. 
The interpretation will define justifiable self-defense and protect the rights of good Samaritans, as well as encourage people to help each other and promote friendliness, the Supreme People's Court said in a statement on Tuesday. 
It did not disclose when the interpretation will be released to the public. 
The interpretation has been written into the top court's plan for implementing socialist core values in the next five years, according to the statement. 
Under the plan, the court will also highlight the importance of protecting personal information, properties and wildlife through judicial interpretations.
