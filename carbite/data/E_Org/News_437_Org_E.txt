China's stance on the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue is consistent and clear, and China hopes all relevant parties adhere to the direction of political settlement, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Saturday. 
Spokesperson Lu Kang made the comments when asked about recent remarks by the United States that China's attitude toward the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue has changed, which influenced the process of resolving the issue through negotiation between the United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). 
In response, Lu said those remarks went against basic facts and were irresponsible. China has expressed grave concerns and lodged solemn representations to the United States. 
"For many years China has made unremitting efforts to and played an important and constructive role in pushing for the proper solution to the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue," Lu said. "China has always comprehensively and strictly implemented the resolutions of the UN Security Council on the DPRK, which is obvious to all." 
Lu said China supports the United States and the DPRK in actively advancing the process of political settlement to the issue according to the consensus reached by the two countries' leaders in Singapore. However, he added that all relevant parties should stick to the direction of political settlement, and show more sincerity and flexibility, instead of being fickle or laying the blame on others. 
"China will continue to keep close communication with relevant parties and play a positive role in achieving the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and lasting peace and stability of Northeast Asia," he said.
