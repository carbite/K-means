BEIJING -- China will launch a reference range exclusively for Chinese children's blood test indicators next year, according to the Beijing Evening News on Monday. 
Previously, the reference ranges of domestic adults' or overseas children's blood test indicators were widely used for domestic children's blood tests. 
"Take serum creatinine, an indicator reflecting the renal function, as an example," Song Wenqi, a doctor at Beijing Children's Hospital, was quoted as saying by the newspaper. "The indicator covers a large range, without distinguishing gender and age." 
Cooperating with several medical organizations, Beijing Children's Hospital has collected blood samples from more than 13,000 healthy children of different ages. 
The children's reference range will cover 31 blood test indicators related to whole cell analysis, bone metabolism and renal function.
